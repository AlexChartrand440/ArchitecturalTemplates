ArchitecturalTemplates
======================
The Architectural Template method is an efficient design-time engineering method for analyzing scalability, elasticity, and efficiency properties of SaaS applications. This method quantifies such properties based on reusable analysis templates — so called Architectural Templates.
CloudScale includes the Architectural Template language in ScaleDL and provides a catalogue of Architectural Templates specified in this language. CloudScale’s Architectural Templates manifest all quality-relevant characteristics intrinsic to given cloud computing environments. Architects only have to fill-in the parts specific to their concrete SaaS application.
